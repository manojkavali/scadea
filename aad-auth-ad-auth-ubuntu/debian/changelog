aad-auth (0.5.2) mantic; urgency=medium

  * Update Go version to 1.21
    - This is not a new feature breakage. The previous build introduced
      a new symbol required by golang-go-1.21, so we need to bump the
      minimal required Go version to 1.21.
  * Update MSAL version to 1.2.0
  * Update dependencies to latest:
    ** Rust
      - cc
      - libnss
      - time
    ** Go
      - golang.org/x/sys
  * Clean up some packaging steps
    - Some workarounds were necessary due to unmerged upstream changes. Now
      the fixes are merged and released, so packaging could be cleaned up.
  * Update CI dependencies not related to package functionality:
    - github.com/golangci/golangci-lint

aad-auth (0.5) mantic; urgency=medium

  * New release (LP: #2031534)
  * Update Go version to 1.20
  * Update MSAL version to 1.1
  * Specify default scopes for authentication
    - After MSAL 1.0, the API no longer provides a set of default scopes in
      case none was specified. So now we specify the authentication scopes
      manually.
  * Normalize names used in NSS queries
    - Lowercase the names used in all queries to account for the case
      insensitivity of AAD.
  * Consider effective UID/GID when evaluating access to Shadow database:
    - This fixes the issue where AAD users could not open sudo sessions, even
      though they were part of the sudo group
  * Improved errors messages
    - Show link(s) to error code(s) description on Microsoft's site
  * Update dependencies to latest:
    ** Go
      - github.com/mattn/go-sqlite3
      - github.com/sirupsen/logrus
      - github.com/spf13/cobra
      - github.com/stretchr/testify
      - golang.org/x/crypto
      - golang.org/x/sys
    ** Rust

aad-auth (0.4) lunar; urgency=medium

  * First upload to ubuntu
  * Rewrite NSS module in Rust: we canâ€™t use Go to implicit use of threads
    which is incompatible with binaries linking against use and only using
    fork() without exec().

aad-auth (0.3) kinetic; urgency=medium

  [ Gabriel Nagy ]
  * Add aad-cli binary package (LP: #1989413)
    - this is a CLI that allows managing various aspects of the AAD
      integration, such as:
      - editing the configuration file in a safe way
      - querying cached users/groups attributes
      - updating cached user attributes (shell/homedir)
  * Update debian/copyright with the latest vendored dependencies

  [ Denison Barbosa ]
  * Improve consistency of offline credentials expiration
    - a negative value disables offline authentication, and 0 prevents
    the cache clean up process, allowing offline login for an
    undetermined amount of time

  [ Didier Roche ]

  [ Gabriel Nagy ]
  [ Jean-Baptiste Lallement ]
  * Rewrite NSS Go library in C
    - due to random crashes caused by loading a multithreaded shared library
      written in Go from NSS, we now have a thin C wrapper calling a Go
      executable which does the actual queries
  * Add translations supported by gettext to the PAM module
    - to support the future CLI integration, these are shipped in a
      common architecture-independent package
  * Ship a configuration template in the common package
  * Fix segfault on interrupted pam conversation
  * Fix FTBFS on armhf due to int type size
  * Various test improvements and fixes
  * Update dependencies to latest:
    - github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-library-for-go
    - github.com/go-ini/ini
    - github.com/mattn/go-sqlite3
